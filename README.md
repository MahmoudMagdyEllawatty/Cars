# Party-Coordinator
-------------------------

Problem description:
-----------------------------
- When you have an occasion such as receiving a patient returning from treatment abroad or the return of a student after graduation or the establishment of weddings need a lot of different equipment of eating and drinking and various decorations to suit your occasion
- I work in the field of providing services for the reception and I face many difficulties in forgetting the request from the client, the error in the quantities and qualities required, asking the customer to cancel the request at a time when I have already purchased the purposes of the ceremony
----------------------------------------------------
Suggested solution:
-------------------------------------------------------

Developing a mobile application that connects the client with the reception and party services provider 

through which the client can view the services provided Request the service and pay online.

The concert coordinator will provide a brief overview at the beginning of the application on how to use and the services provided.

The application is divided into main sections within the package and the price of each.

The customer chooses the right time and date and then completes the purchase after accepting the terms and conditions set by the application owner
